#Medical Images Classification

This is an image classification project partially guided by Codecademy as a part of fulfilment of my course 'Build a Deep Learning Model with Tensorflow'.\
\
The model is build with Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab and is saved as both a Python (.py) file and a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file.\
It successfully classifies up to 80% of images containing lungs of COVID-19 patients, pneumonia patients and normal lungs.\
The final categorcal accuracy is 78.71% and the AUC is 93.06%, which is considered accurate given the amount of data we are provided.\
